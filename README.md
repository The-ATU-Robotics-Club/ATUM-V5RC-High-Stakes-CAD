# ATUM-VRC-Over-Under-CAD
 This repository contains ATUM's CAD for the VEX Robotics Competition 2024-2025 game, High Stakes.

## Important Note about Mirroring
When mirroring in AutoDesk Inventor, be sure to click the option to reuse
selected objects for VEX parts. 

This option becomes available after clicking on the components in the mirroring
dialog box;  
it is the yellow option with the white cross. Mirroring the parts themselves
creates a new component file which may be desirable for 3D printed and custom
parts, but is **NOT** desirable for stock VEX parts. 

If you forget to do this and create mirrored files of stock VEX parts, the
changes will *not* be tracked (and therefore not appear on other machines
pulling the repo).
